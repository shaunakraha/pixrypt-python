Pixrypt Text-Pixel Encryption and Decryption - Python Backend
=============================================================

The Python Backend for the `Pixrypt Text to Pixel Encryption and Decryption system
<http://pixrypt.com>`_.

This projects provides the backend encryption and password generation and decryption with provided password for
Pixrypt image generation and reading.

`The source for this project is available here
<https://github.com/shaunakraha/pixrypt-python>`_.

All other Pixrypt base their image encoding and decoding logic on this module.

----

The Project is structured as follows:

1) Encoder - Contains the logic for converting plain text to a Pixrypt image and providing a passphrase.
2) Decoder - Contains the logic for converting a Pixrypt image to plain text with a provided passphrase.
